# CompSys_scripts 2019-Exam
This is a repo containing a collection of scripts for the exam in Computer Systems at Copenhagen University.
All programs/scripts are open-source, and all contributions are welcome, even for this README, if it's an improvement.

All scripts should be written in a language installed by default in most unix's distro's, for best coverage.

## Implementation
* The scripts/program's primary goal is ease of use, and fast results. 
* GUI and other fancy stuff are not important.
* Scripts should include README, or be able to print 'Usage: ...' message when calling [-h | --help].

Remember these scripts should be used at your own risk, and could need to be updated to keep-up with potential changes in how the tasks looks, in the following years. You should have a good enough understanding of the tasks, to solve them without the need of scripts. This would also help you catch potential mistakes made by the program, by having an approximate of the expected result.
